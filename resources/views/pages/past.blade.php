				</div>
				<div class="timeline-body">
					<p>Malcolm III was nicknamed the Great Chief (Canmore). He had two marriages, both that resulted in children. His first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdotter, assumedly died before 1070, one of his sons from this marriage became king of Scotland. His second wife; Margret of Wessex, came to Scotland as a refugee. By the end of 1070, the two were married. This marriage yielded eight children, three of which became King of Scotland for a time. It was from Margret's family that the children's names came from. Malcolm III, while not overly pious, greatly respected his wife's religious nature and ordered that a church be made for her. That church was built upon the current site of the Abbey. Before its' completion, Malcolm decreed that the church was to the house the new Royal Sepulchre of Scotland. That is why the Abbey holds a great number of Scottish Royals.</p>
